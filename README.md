# Project Nenu
Project N(ew m)enu is a garry's mod lua code that replaces standard html based menu with standalone lua menu.

## How to install/update?
* Download archive
* Locate garry's mod local files directory
 ** For steam: Library -> Garry's Mod -> Browse local files
* Go to "garrysmod" folder
* Go to "lua" folder
* Delete "menu" folder contents
 ** Even though I say "delete", i recommend you to just rename original folder into something like "menu-old". That way, if steam does not find any errors in files while uninstalling, you can restore it back manually
* Place archive contents in "menu" folder

## How to uninstall?
* Just verify garry's mod contents in steam

## What's new?
Fully reworked menu. Really. Including start game, server connect, and addons menus.

## Why?
I was tired of original garry's mod menu, so, I made my own.

## TODO:
* Bring back dupes and saves menu buttons
* Bring back addon collections
* Bring back image backgrounds
