# Project Nenu
Project N(ew m)enu is a garry's mod lua code that replaces standard html based menu with standalone lua menu.

## How to install/update?
1. Download archive.
2.  Locate garry's mod local files directory
  2.1. For steam: Library -> Garry's Mod -> Browse local files
3. Go to "garrysmod" folder
4. Go to "lua" folder
5. Delete "menu" folder contents  
   5.1. Even though I say "delete", i recommend you to just rename original folder into something like "menu-old". That way, if steam does not find any errors in files while uninstalling, you can restore it back manually
6. Place archive contents in "menu" folder

## How to uninstall?
1. Just verify garry's mod contents in steam  
  1.1. If it fails, delete "menu" folder and try again.  
  1.2. If it also fails, rename original menu folder (if you have one) into "menu"

## What's new?
* Fully reworked menu. Really. Including start game, server connect, and addons menus.
* New loading screen.
* **Probably** better perfomance
* Lua error log file (located in garrysmod/data/project_nenu/logs/lua.txt)

## Why?
I was tired of original garry's mod menu, so, I made my own.

## TODO:
* Bring back dupes and saves menu buttons
* Bring back addon collections
* Bring back image backgrounds
* Bring back server custom html loading screens
